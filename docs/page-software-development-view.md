## Introduction

### General Development Information

The developer view provides developers with resources to utilize the EcoPass KIT effectively. On the one side developers can learn how to integrate the EcoPass KIT into their applications and to make use of the product passport exchanging feature via the Catena-X network. On the other side, IT-Administrators will learn how to provide the needed passport data and which components are required.
Thereby, this KIT covers various aspects, starting from how the available API Endpoints can be utilized for data models and how to make them available in the Catena-x Data Space.

### Architecture Overview

The following Figure shows how the EcoPass KIT (represented by Digital Product Passport Frontend and Backend) is embedded in the overall architecture.

## Data Retrieval Flow

In order to retrieve data in the Catena-X Network a number of services need to be available and have data register on them. Otherwise the data retrieval would simply not work because the consumer application would not "find" the specific searched asset even if it would be registered in the provider side.

Therefore here below is provided a series of prerequisites that need to be fulfilled in the network to assure that the data can be retrieved and found:

Using the discovery services from Catena-X


Here is a diagram of the data retrial flow necessary to retrieve any data from the Catena-X Network without any optimizations:

[![Data Retrieval Flow](./resources/development-view/dataRetrievalFlow.jpg)](./resources/development-view/dataRetrievalFlow.jpg)


### 1. Discovery Phase

At the beginning we start calling the `Discovery Service` which is responsible for giving us the urls from the `BPN Discovery` and the `EDC Discovery` this two service give us first a `BPN or Business Partner Number` for a specific `id` and the `EDC Discovery` will give you a list of EDC registered by one company's `BPN`.

### 2. Digital Twin Registry Search Phase

Once we have a list of `EDCs` we need to find which of this EDCs contain the `Digital Twin Registry` component. We can filter which `EDCs` contain the `Digital Twin Registry` by simply calling for the catalog with the `type` condition of the contract that must have the `data.core.digitalTwinRegistry` standardized type. 

Once we have the list of DTRs we need to negotiate each contract retrieve in the catalog so that we can have the `Contract Agreement Id` which is given by the EDC once the contact is signed and agreed. This id will be used later to request the transfer for the `EDR` token for accessing the `Digital Twin Registry` through the `EDC Provider Data Plane Proxy`. 

### 3. Digital Twin Search Phase

We need to search for the `Digital Twins` inside of the `Digital Twin Registries`, and once we found it we can start the negotiation for the `submodelDescriptor` we are searching for that can be for example a: `Digital Product Pass`, `Battery Pass`, `Single Level BOM as Built` or a `Transmission Pass`.

### 4. Data Negotiation and Transfer Phase

Once we have the submodel we are going to call the [`subprotocolBody`](#L233) url of the `endpoint interface` with name `SUBMODEL-3.0`. This will provide for us the asset id to negotiate with the EDC Provider. Once this asset is negotiated we will request for the `transfer` and `EDR` token will be sent to the backend by the EDC Provider, allowing us to query the dataplane url contained in the `href` field of the endpoint interface. And in this way we will retrieve the data using the `EDC Provider Data Plane Proxy`.


## Technical Detailed Phases

In order to achieve a better understanding of the Eco Pass KIT data retrieval flow, we can detail a specific example where an user wants to retrieve an specific passport for a asset in Catena-X using the Eco Pass KIT (reference implementation [`digital-product-pass`](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/digital-product-pass)).

## 1. Discovery Phase + 2. Digital Twin Registry Search Phase

After the discovery phase, the search for digital twin registries is one of the core components to be done when retrieving data in Catena-X.
Once the negotiation for the digital twin registries assets are done we would be able to retrieve a catalog for the user to search the serialized Id (key: partInstanceId, example value: batteryDMC_code).

### Prerequisites

The following information is required to enable the decentralized search for digital twin registries:

| Name | Example | Description |
| ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| Search Id Type | *manufacturerPartId* | The search id type is required first of all to know in which `BPN Discovery` services to search. It will be introduced in the `Discovery Service` and we will obtain a list of `BPN Discovery Endpoints`. After this same id will be introduce as the *`type`* attribute in each `BPN Discovery`. |
| Search Id Value | *XYZ78901* | The search id value is required for searching in the `BPN Discovery` services. One example could be the `product type id` of a company, which is owned by an unique `BPN` reducing the complexity of the search.
