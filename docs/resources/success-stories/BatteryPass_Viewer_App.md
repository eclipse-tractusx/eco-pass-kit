Battery Pass Viewer App – Success Story

The battery pass viewer app is one of the first functional applications for visualizing product passports, developed within the Catena-X initiative. 
This app is set to shape the way access to and interaction with digital product passports is made, by consolidating relevant product information in one tool in the most convenient way as possible.
The battery pass viewer app offers a simple solution for accessing digital product passports. All it takes is scanning a product's QR code or entering its unique ID, and you are immediately taken to the product's digital passport. 
By harnessing the capabilities of the Catena-X principles and network, the app ensures secure authorizations and data retrieval as well as reliable data quality across an entire value chain. 
This way, the viewer app ultimately sets new standards for accessibility and usability of product information and enables further application scenarios for product data.
The advantages of the battery pass viewer app are numerous. It simplifies the process of getting product information, making the process easy and efficient and consolidating relevant information in one place. 
As such, the app provides valuable KPIs in four critical areas: General, Performance, Health, and Sustainability, offering relevant insights for an initial assessment of a product. Furthermore, six additional information categories, namely *General Information*, *Product Condition*, *Composition*, *Cell Chemistry*, *Electrochemical Properties*, and *Additional Information*, are included. 
These categories provide further detailed information about a product, such as its material composition or additional information, like certificates or disassembly instructions.

The battery pass viewer app is provided as a FOSS application so that I can be implemented by every interested party without additional cost. Moreover, it is fully compliant and compatible with the Catena-X principles and infrastructure, which makes it currently the only digital product passport application that can be used operationally on a large scale. 
Furthermore, compliance with Catena-X ensures appropriate data security and interoperability with various extant infrastructures in place, creating a low entry barrier.
The battery pass viewer app offers the consolidation of relevant battery information in one place and thus represents the first useable digital product passport application, however, currently limited to only batteries. 
Nevertheless, extension to further products and adding additional features are already planned, ultimately improving the user experience and overall value add of the application.
